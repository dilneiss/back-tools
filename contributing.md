# Contributing

Contributions are _very_ welcome, but because this package is closed-source, it's more difficult than with our open-source package.

Please open a new issue in [this repo](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/devtools-issues) with your idea. Include any code if you can (as text, zip, gist - anything you can) and we'll create a PR out of it. If it's a large PR let us know, we might give you access for a month or so. We'd love to give access to everyone who bought (for the duration of their update period) but unfortunately we can't, since Github incrues costs per collaborator per month.

But considering this is a paid product, you probably just want to ask us to build it ðŸ˜€ You can do that [here](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/devtools-issues).

## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option, so if you think there's a change that you're introducing a breaking change, please let us know in your PR.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.


Thank you for helping us out!
